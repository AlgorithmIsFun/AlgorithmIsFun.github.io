	<h2>Introducing Me</h2>
	<p>As a University of Toronto student, I am pursuing a role where I can leverage my education, skills and previous experience to further grow and drive a positive impact.
As a current student, I have developed critical thinking skills through my education which I use to illustrate, quantify and interpret complex problems in the work environment. I have completed management and computer science courses at University and high school while receiving multiple academic awards. In addition, I have been working as a cashier at Walmart Canada for the past year. During this time, I was responsible to hitting quotas and advertise multiple customer service promotions while driving excellent customer service. I have proven to be a hard-working associate and always drive strong customer service. I am also very involved in the community as a volunteer to increase my leadership skills. During my time as a FSG Leader, I am responsible of managing a classroom setting and assisting with the understanding of course concepts. I believe that my previous experience and personal drive has well prepared me for this employment opportunity.
I am confident that my skills qualify me for this position with your company and I am certain I will be able to positively contribute to your team. I trust that this opportunity will allow me to see the greater vista of possibilities to further develop and grow as an individual and I look forward to hearing from you.
